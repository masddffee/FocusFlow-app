# MCP Frontend-Backend Integration Test Report
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Test Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Project:** FocusFlow - AI Smart Learning Planner  
**API:** Gemini 2.5 Flash

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Critical frontend-backend integration issues have been successfully resolved and verified through comprehensive MCP testing.**

The user reported that Smart Generate functionality was completely broken despite my previous claims of successful testing. The root cause was identified as incomplete testing methodology - I had only tested backend APIs directly via curl commands, not the actual frontend-backend integration that users experience.

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Hardcoded API Configuration**: Fixed port mismatch (8080 → 3000) in frontend
2. **Unified Configuration System**: Restored proper integration between appConfig.ts and utils/api.ts
3. **Backend Startup Issues**: Resolved uv_cwd errors and verified stable operation
4. **Testing Methodology**: Created comprehensive MCP integration tests for actual user experience validation

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Configuration System Integration Test ✅

**Objective**: Verify that hardcoded configuration issues were resolved and unified config system works properly.

**Results**:
```
✅ API Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/api (IPv4 localhost)
✅ Hardcoded configuration fixed: Port 8080 → 3000
✅ utils/api.ts integration: Using getConfig() system
✅ appConfig.ts integration: Unified configuration loading
✅ Backend running on correct port: 3000
```

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `utils/api.ts` to import `getConfig()` from `appConfig.ts`
- Replaced hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` with dynamic `getApiBaseUrl()` function
- Verified IPv4 connectivity (avoiding IPv6 connection issues)
